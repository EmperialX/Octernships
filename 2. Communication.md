## Overview ‚ùáÔ∏è
Welcome to the Part (1/3) of GitHub Octernship Partner handbook. In this section, you will understand how as a Partner you can communicate with students from the application phase to selection phase in the program. 

### GitHub Discussions üí¨

GitHub Discussions are a great way to make public discussions and announcements during the selection phase of the Octernship. Community members can ask and answer questions, share updates, and have open-ended conversations. Discussions enable fluid, open conversation in a public forum. Discussions give space for more collaborative conversations by connecting and giving a more centralized area to connect and find information.

You can setup GitHub Discussions in:

1. Your Project Repository: Useful for project-related discussions
2. [GitHub Education Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/categories/github-education): A public discussion under the GitHub Education Community, suitable for public announcements.


### Enabling GitHub Discussions on your repository ‚úÖ


    Repository owners and people with write access can enable GitHub Discussions for a community on their public and private repositories. The visibility of a discussion is inherited from the repository the discussion is created in.



1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the repository‚Äôs main page.
2. Under your repository name, click _Settings_.

5. Click Start discussion.

### Enabling GitHub Discussions in your organization üí¨

Organization owners can enable GitHub Discussions for their organization.

When you enable organization discussions, you will choose a repository in the organization to be the source repository for your organization discussions. You can use an existing repository or create a repository specifically to hold your organization's discussions. Discussions will appear both on the discussions page for the organization and on the discussion page for the source repository.

You can change the source repository at any time. If you change the source repository, discussions are not transferred to the new source repository.



1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of your organization.
2. Under your organization name, click  Settings.

5. Click Save.


### Creating a new discussion üí¨

Any authenticated user who can view the repository can create a discussion in that repository. Similarly, since organization discussions are based on a source repository, any authenticated user who can view the source repository can create a discussion in that organization.



1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository or organization where you want to start a discussion.
2. Under your repository or organization name, click  Discussions.

### Promoting healthy conversations üë•

People with write permissions for the repository, or for the source repository for organization discussions, can help surface important conversations by pinning discussions, deleting discussions that are no longer useful or are damaging to the community, and transferring discussions to more relevant repositories owned by the organization. For more information, see "[Managing discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions)."


## GitHub Octernships Discord üíñ

GitHub Octernships Discord server is a private communication platform for selected students i.e. Octerns only. Invites to all Partners POC will be rolled out via email by GitHub Staff. 

* `#Announcements`: All Octernship announcements are made in this channel, including deadlines, Octernship Streams, or anything every Octern needs to know.
* `#general`: This is a common channel for all Octerns to meet and greet each other and with the partners and GitHub team.
* `#Organization_NAME`: This is a dedicated channel for your organisation and your Octerns. You can use this throughout the Octernship to communicate with the Octern. This is helpful during onboarding.

_Note: GitHub Education Discord is for selected Octerns only, if you want to make a public announcement for the braoder student community consider using [GitHub Discussions](#heading=h.v7525k4g1v0d)_


## Organization Platform üì•

Partners can choose to use their existing org communication platform related to the project with the student/Octern. We recommend using the [GitHub Education Discord](#heading=h.fgh44fxmvybe) channel during onboarding. 


## Staff Communication (GitHub) üìß

All communication with GitHub Staff can be done via email [partners-octernship@github.com](mailto:partners-octernship@github.com)
