## Terminology ❔

#### GitHub Octernship Stream

GitHub Octernship Stream is a 30 min LIVE session for all Octernship Partners to deliver technical education content on their product/service and expectations from the Classroom Assignment. This will be hosted on GitHub Education YouTube.   

#### Stream

A stream is a one-time segment, often lasting one hour, hosted on [GitHub Education YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@githubeducation4427). You are be able to host a stream of your choice after opting for it in the [Octernship Application](#submitting-the-octernship-project-application-form)

Moderators will have a wrench icon ![](https://i.imgur.com/HzPIogT.png) in front of their name when they use the YouTube Chat


#### Guest

Session Speaker or facilitator from a Partner organization


### Onboarding 📺 

You have opted YES to participate in Octernship Stream. This section will tell you the following steps to onboard you for your Octernship Stream! 



1. The GitHub Staff will send you an email with a [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) link to schedule your stream, pick a slot based on your availabilty
2. The email will also contain optional questions which will help us understand your stream and support the promotion of your stream
2. Star or Bookmark the email thread. The GitHub team will be using email to send you reminders before the stream and also send you any relevant information


### Promotion ✨

Let the world know about your show! The Octernship Team will provide support for your stream’s promotion. We also encourage you to use your platform channels to promote your stream for maximum reach. Adding extra context in the [onboarding](#heading=h.isp8y2d3nwii) email about your show will help us promote it better!

Here are some tips to help attract the audience to your stream

* What are the main takeaways the audience will get from this stream?
* How is this technology, tool, or framework currently being used in the world? 


We recommend tagging [@GitHubEducation](https://twitter.com/GitHubEducation) so we can retweet/repost your post on the stream! The GitHub team will schedule social posts for your Octernship Stream regardless.


### Hosting the stream 🎙

You will get a reminder on the “day of” your stream from the GitHub Staff. We’ll use Streamyard to Livestream the show to GitHub Education’s [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@githubeducation4427).  
All you have to do is join the Streamyard with the link provided to you and host the stream.  


_Tip: We recommend joining 15 minutes before your stream for a stage check_


## Using Streamyard 🎥

You’ll be provided a Streamyard link via email. No Streamyard account is required for you to access this. If this is your first time using Streamyard:

* Allow Access to Mic and Camera to Streamyard
* Add your Name, Designation, and Pronouns (optional but recommended) 
* Hit Enter Studio to enter the studio from backstage


### Setting up Streamyard 🎥

When you enter the Streamyard backstage, you must bring yourself up (or ask the GitHub Staff to do so) to the stage. 

_Note: If you’re sharing a screen, you need to bring that screen onto the stage too! Always double-check if your screen is visible to the audience._

The Backstage, just like it says, will not show any activity you do to the audience, this includes your audio/video or screen. This is also where a GitHub Staff will be throughout the stream to support you. You can highlight comments during the stream, this is handy when you are answering a question or having a conversation with the audience and want them to have a context of what you are talking about.



### Setting up Streamyard 👀 [DEMO]

> Tip: We highly recommend doing a stage check 10 minutes before the stream for an improved experience

* Audio: If you’re using an external mic, consider how to switch devices
* Video: If you’re using an external camera, and want to upscale the video quality
* Screen Sharing: How to share the screen (with/without audio) and bring it up or down the stage
* Comments Highlighting: Highlight the audience’s comment on the stream when you talk about it so everyone can catch up with you
* Private Chat: Chat with the people backstage, this may include guests or the staff you want to talk to.  \


> Note: A GitHub staff will be available with you backstage of the stream to assist you with anything you need help with.


### When things go wrong 😱

Sometimes, things go wrong. We make mistakes and being live on the internet can amplify the repercussions of these mistakes. Being live on an account associated with GitHub also means that when things go wrong, they need to be reported. Things can go wrong as a result of saying something you shouldn’t have said, trolls infiltrating chat, or just a blooper of sorts due to being live  in the uncontrolled environment of roommates, parents, and animals that are our homes. 

When something goes wrong, please, reach out to GitHub Staff directly about the course of action. Once your incident report has been filed, the GitHub Education team will meet to decide if further steps need to be taken. For the silly bloopers or unfortunately expected trolls, this is mostly a matter of keeping track of what’s happening on the account so we can assess the metrics. For something more serious, we will reach out and schedule a time to hear what you witnessed during the experience. We will also likely reach out to any other parties involved. 


### Stream FAQ and Tips 💡

* The stream availability has changed unexpectedly, what do I do? 
    * Immediately let the GitHub Staff know about your availability change so we can suggest the next steps
* What do I do in the stream? 
    * Set a stream format: We recommend this flow 👇
        1. Introduction: You introduce the technology and its prerequisites to the audience
        2. Live Demo: Learning by doing is the best way to teach technology!
        3. QnA: It’s essential to leave time for questions, you can either answer them along the way or collectively near the end of your stream.
* Watch the clock:
    * You may have a lot of information and not a lot of time
    * Focus on areas that will bring the most value to the audience (e.g, completing demos, dropping follow-up resources, and sharing point of contact)
* Submit the feedback form immediately 
    * Feedbacks make the most impact while your memory is fresh. We suggest submitting the feedback form within a few hours of completing the stream
* Keeping the audience engaged: 
    * Break the ice, attract participation and increase engagement with the audience by running swag giveaways or highlighting active attendees (feel free to come up with new ways to increase engagement)
